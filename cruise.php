            <h2>Alaskan Cruises from $850</h2>
            <span>Filled with icy fjords that tower over the Pacific Ocean while snowy peaks stretch towards the horizon, Alaska feels boundless. Yet incredibly intimate as you watch eagles nesting along coastal forests. We let you explore all sides of Alaska the way locals see it, up close and personal on an Alaskan cruise. Experience the thrill of a 30 ton whale gliding under your catamaran. Kids' faces will light up like the midnight sun as they enjoy special kids activities and entertainment on board Jewel and Sun.

            <h2>Mexican Cruises from $700</h2>
            <span>
 Experience a whole enchilada’s worth of rich culture and fun on a cruise to Mexico. Each port — including favorites Cozumel, Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta — contributes its own distinct local flavor to the mix. Whether your Mexico cruise style is west-coast Riviera with its Pacific charm, east-coast Caribbean and its island mojo… or perhaps Baja and its out-of-this-world coastal scenery, you’ll find Mexico central to a great vacation.

            <h2>Mediterranean Cruises from $1200</h2>
            <span>Few places in the world pack in as much culture per square meter as Europe does… and nobody packs fun into Europe like Carnival does! There’s so much variety across the continent and its islands, and with Carnival you have options for experiencing many of these places by sea. Cruise the Mediterranean and soak in the espresso-fueled, yet somehow unhurried, cobblestone-lined street life from a sidewalk café.
